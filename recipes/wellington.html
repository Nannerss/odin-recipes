            <h1>Beef Wellington</h1> 
            <img src="wellington.jpeg">
            <p>     A traditional Beef Wellington consists of a beef tenderloin wrapped in layers 
                of pâté, duxelles (a finely chopped mushroom mixture), parma ham, and puff 
                pastry, then baked. Rumor has it that Beef Wellington got its name from 
                Arthur Wellesley, the 1st Duke of Wellington, who counted the dish among 
                his favorite recipes. Whether this is true or not, Beef Wellington has 
                become an iconic example of English cuisine, and follows a long tradition 
                of meats baked in pastry dough.</p>

                    <li>leaves from 1 thyme sprig</li>
                    <li>2tbsp unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>12 thin slices prosciutto</li>
                    <li>all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>14oz frozen puff pastry</li>
                    <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
                    <li>flaky salt</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Using kitchen twine, tie tenderloin in 4 places. 
                    Season generously with salt and pepper. </li>
                <li>Over high heat, coat bottom of a heavy skillet with olive oil. 
                    Once pan is nearly smoking, sear tenderloin until well-browned on all 
                    sides, including the ends, about 2 minutes per side (12 minutes total). 
                    Transfer to a plate. When cool enough to handle, snip off twine and 
                    coat all sides with mustard. Let cool in fridge.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make duxelles: In a food processor, pulse mushrooms, 
                    shallots, and thyme until finely chopped. </li>
                <li>To skillet, add butter and melt over medium heat. 
                    Add mushroom mixture and cook until liquid has evaporated, 
                    about 25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, 
                    then let cool in fridge. </li>
                <li>Place plastic wrap down on a work surface, overlapping so that its 
                    twice the length and width of the tenderloin. Shingle the prosciutto 
                    on the plastic wrap into a rectangle thats big enough to cover the 
                    whole tenderloin. Spread the duxelles evenly and thinly over the 
                    prosciutto. </li>
                <li>Season tenderloin, then place it at the bottom of the prosciutto. 
                    Roll meat into prosciutto-mushroom mixture, using plastic wrap to roll 
                    tightly. Tuck ends of prosciutto as you roll, then twist ends of 
                    plastic wrap tightly into a log and transfer to fridge to chill 
                    (this helps it maintain its shape).</li>
                <li>Heat oven to 425°. Lightly flour your work surface, then spread out 
                    puff pastry and roll it into a rectangle that will cover the 
                    tenderloin (just a little bigger than the prosciutto rectangle you 
                    just made!). Remove tenderloin from plastic wrap and place on bottom 
                    of puff pastry. Brush the other three edges of the pastry with egg 
                    wash, then tightly roll beef into pastry.</li>
                <li>Once the log is fully covered in puff pastry, trim any extra pastry, 
                    then crimp edges with a fork to seal well. 
                    Wrap roll in plastic wrap to get a really tight cylinder, 
                    then chill for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove plastic wrap, then transfer roll to a foil-lined baking sheet. 
                    Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with flaky salt. </li>
                <li>Bake until pastry is golden and the center registers 120°F for 
                    medium-rare, about 40 to 45 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes before 
                    carving and serving.</li>
